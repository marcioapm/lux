"""workload.beforeStop: a command the Run leaves behind with, on every stop.

The shim runs it in the container before the workload is signalled — for a
stop asked for, a terminate, a timeout — as the workload's user with its
environment. What it writes into $LUX_ARTIFACTS is collected like any
artifact, and a hook that overruns is cut off rather than holding the stop.
