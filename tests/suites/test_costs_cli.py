"""Run costs through the CLI: a static host's price becomes the compute
line of a Run on it, which `lux cost`, `lux costs --by family` and the COST
column of `lux ls` show.

The Run is costed as it ends: its state change queues it, and the drainer
(every 2s, woken by the Run's events) writes the compute line and its
hourly row. No cost tick (every 2m) is waited for."""
