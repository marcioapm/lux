# Cloudflare Tunnel + Access in front of luxd: nothing exposed directly.
# The tunnel's only ingress is http://localhost:<origin_port> (luxd,
# reached over loopback since cloudflared runs on the control host
# itself); DNS for the chosen hostname points at the tunnel.
#
# Access sits at Cloudflare's edge, in front of the tunnel, and makes its
# allow/deny decision purely on request domain/path against an
# application's policies — it never looks at the request body or headers
# (an `Authorization: Bearer <key>` does not make Access let a request
# through). So two Access applications, not one:
#
#   - "console", on the bare hostname: an allow policy for the given
#     emails/domains. This is what gates a person opening the console in
#     a browser.
#   - "api-bypass", on the /v1/* and /runner/* destinations under the
#     same hostname: a `bypass` decision, matching everyone. Runners
#     authenticate with a per-host runner token and API/CLI clients with
#     lux API keys (docs/operators.md "Signing in"), both checked by
#     luxd itself, not Access — internal/server/access.go's consoleUser
#     only ever runs for a request with *no* API key. Without this
#     second application, every /v1 and /runner request would need an
#     Access session before it even reached luxd, which breaks runners
#     and the CLI outright (neither can obtain one).
#
# Access resolves overlapping applications by specificity (more specific
# path wins — see the provider's docs on application paths), so
# api-bypass's narrower match on /v1/* and /runner/* takes precedence
# over console's bare-hostname match for those paths, and console's
# allow policy still governs everything else. The console's own browser
# calls to /v1 (e.g. streaming output) go through api-bypass at the edge
# and are unauthenticated *there*, but still carry the CF_Authorization
# cookie Access set when the person signed in; luxd's own consoleUser
# check reads that cookie directly, so the console keeps working without
# Access gating /v1 a second time.
