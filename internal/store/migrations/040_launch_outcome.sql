-- 040_launch_outcome.sql — how a provisioned host's launch went, apart
-- from its operational state.
--
-- A host whose launch the provider refused is still operationally
-- `terminated` (it leaves every active host list; its one-use token is
-- revoked and its copies are gone, as before). launch_outcome records what
-- happened to the launch itself:
--
--   requested  luxd asked the provider; no answer recorded yet
--   launched   the provider started an instance (it may later never
--              register, be lost, or disappear: those stay reasons of
--              the terminated state)
--   failed     the provider refused: no instance ever existed
--   abandoned  luxd never recorded an answer and wrote the row off
--
-- NULL: a host that registered itself (no launch), or one from before this
-- migration whose launch could not be told apart.

-- left a terminated row whose reason starts "launch failed: ", with no

-- (first placement) or the previous placement's end stands in.
