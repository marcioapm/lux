-- 053_run_expiry.sql — a resting Run (stopped, lost, failed) expires: once
-- it has rested longer than its tenant's expire_after_days, the reaper
-- cancels it (reapExpiry).

-- state_changed_at: when the Run entered its current state. Set by every
-- state change (setRunState, requestResume, assign); updated_at is not the
-- clock, as other writes move it.

-- Existing Runs: their latest state event, else updated_at.
