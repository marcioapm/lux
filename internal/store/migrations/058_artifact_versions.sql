-- 058_artifact_versions.sql — artifacts are versioned per (run_id, path):
-- a file published again under its name, or collected again with other
-- content, is the next version; none is replaced. Published artifacts
-- carry a description.
--
-- Rows recorded before are numbered in the order they were made. luxd
-- assigns max + 1 for the path while it holds the Run's row lock.
--
-- The index is on md5(path): a collected path can be up to PATH_MAX, past
-- a btree tuple's ~2704 bytes. Queries filter md5(path) = md5($n) AND
-- path = $n.
