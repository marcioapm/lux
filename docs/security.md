# Security

What lux isolates, what it trusts, and what an operator must do. Details
are in the linked pages.

## Tenants

- **Row-level security.** Every tenant row (Runs, placements, events,
  snapshots, blobs, keys, samples) is guarded by Postgres row-level
  security. luxd connects as `lux_app`, a role that cannot bypass it
  (`migrate` makes sure: no SUPERUSER, no BYPASSRLS), and sets the tenant
  per transaction. A query without a tenant sees nothing.
- **Hosts** belong to a tenant or to the platform. A tenant sees its own
  hosts and platform hosts, and on a shared platform host only its own
  placements and what they hold ([Operators](operators.md#looking)).
- **Operator keys** belong to no tenant and see every tenant. They are made
  only by `luxd admin create-operator-key`, never through the API. Treat one
  like root.

## Keys and sign-in

- API keys are stored hashed. A key has scopes: `read`, `run`, `admin`
  (each implying the ones before), or `operator`.
- The console signs in with a key, kept in the browser tab's session
  storage only, or through Cloudflare Access (`console.auth =
  "cloudflare-access"`). There luxd verifies every Access token itself:
  signed by the team's keys, for the configured application (AUD), not
  expired. Whoever Access issues a token with an email for is an operator,
  so the Access application's policy is the only gate: keep it to the
  people who should be operators, with no bypass or everyone rules.
  Service tokens (no email) are refused. The Access cookie authenticates
  reads, and writes only when the browser marks them same-origin
  (`Sec-Fetch-Site`), so another site cannot act with it
  ([Operators](operators.md#signing-in)).

## Workloads

- **Containers** run under rootful Podman with `--userns=auto`: each has
  its own user namespace, and container root is not host root. No
  privileged containers; nested containers are opt-in and still
  unprivileged ([Concepts](concepts.md)).
- **Egress** is denied by default per Run, with nftables and a DNS stub;
  the spec allows hosts ([The RunSpec](runspec.md)).
- **Secrets** are never stored: luxd holds their values in memory from the
  submit or resume that supplied them, runners get them over their
  WebSocket, and output is redacted before it is written anywhere
  ([Concepts](concepts.md)). A workload can still write a secret into its
  state volumes; that is its choice, and is snapshotted like anything else.
- **Credentials a workload uses but must not hold** go through a service
  (`workload.services`): lux-shim adds them to each request it forwards
  from a socket in the container. The values are only in the shim's
  memory, and the shim is not dumpable, so even container root (without
  `CAP_SYS_PTRACE`, which no Run has) can't read them from `/proc`. Git
  credentials never enter the container at all: the runner clones and
  pushes.

## Deployment

- **Reach luxd privately**: its API and console carry every tenant's data.
  Put it behind a tunnel, a VPN or Cloudflare Access; lux has no public
  URLs of its own (port forwarding goes through the CLI).
- **Secrets in configuration** (the database password, the S3 secret key)
  are best set in the environment. A configuration file holding them
  should be readable by luxd only (`chmod 600`); luxd warns when others can
  read it ([Operations](operations.md#configuration)).
- **Only luxd holds S3 credentials.** Runners upload and download through
  luxd and presigned URLs.
- **Runners** authenticate with host tokens (`luxd admin
  create-host-token`), scoped to a tenant or the platform and a pool.
