# Operations

## luxd

`luxd` is stateless. Postgres holds state and S3 holds bytes, so you can
run several instances behind a load balancer. Each runner holds one
WebSocket to one instance.

```bash
luxd migrate      # once per upgrade, as the database owner
luxd serve        # as many as you like
```

### Building

`make build` builds the operator console (`console/`, with
[Bun](https://bun.sh)) and then the binaries in `bin/`; luxd embeds the
console. A luxd built with plain `go build` and no console build serves, at
`/`, a page saying how to build it.

### Postgres

Postgres 13 or later (tested on 18); no extensions. `luxd migrate` runs as
the database owner, who must be able to create roles: it creates `lux_app`
(no SUPERUSER, no BYPASSRLS: row-level security is the tenant boundary),
sets its password to `LUX_APP_PASSWORD` (default `lux_app`: set your own),
and grants it every table, new ones included, on each run. `luxd serve`
connects as `lux_app`; `luxd admin` works with either DSN.

Each luxd also holds one long-lived connection, outside its pool and made
with the same DSN, listening for Run events (`LISTEN lux_events`), which
is what makes the console and `lux logs -f` live. LISTEN does not work
through PgBouncer in transaction or statement mode: point luxd at Postgres
directly, or at a session-mode pool. If it cannot listen, updates still
arrive, a few seconds late.

### Upgrading

1. Check the configuration with the new binary: `luxd validate`, run as
   the service user with the unit's environment. It fails (exit 1) on
   anything `luxd serve` would refuse before connecting, with the same
   message; the running luxd is untouched.
2. Run `luxd migrate` with the owner's DSN. It applies what is new and is
   safe to run again; running luxds keep working meanwhile, except while a
   migration builds an index. 045 and 046 index the pool and host events
   tables in their migration's transaction: until each commits, anything
   luxd does that records an event (heartbeats, registration, placements,
   drains) waits — about 3–4 s per million events for the two together.
   A migration that fails on a deadlock with luxd can be run again.
3. Restart (or roll) every `luxd serve` onto the new binary.

Migrate first: a luxd newer than its schema does not check it, and fails
requests that touch what is missing (luxds older than the schema keep
working). Configuration through the environment alone keeps working: a
configuration file is optional.

Each Linux release tarball has a `FEATURES` file at its root, one feature
per line. A deployer reads it before running anything from the release,
since older releases lack both the file and the commands it names:

| Feature | Since the release says it, a deployer may |
| --- | --- |
| `validate` | run `luxd [--config FILE] validate` against the host's configuration before migrating or switching to the release. |

A release with no `FEATURES` file, or no `validate` line, predates
`luxd validate`.

#### Configuration compatibility

A configuration that one release accepts, the next accepts too:

- A new setting always has a default or is optional: a file written for the
  previous release needs no edit.
- A removed setting stays accepted for one more release. luxd ignores it and
  warns `luxd: warning: retired: <key>; remove it` (the TOML key or the
  variable, never its value). The release after that refuses it as an
  unknown key. Retired settings are listed in `retiredKeys`
  (`cmd/luxd/config.go`).

### Configuration

luxd reads a TOML file: `--config FILE` (before or after the command),
else `LUX_CONFIG`, else `/etc/lux/luxd.toml` if it exists. Every setting
also has an environment variable, which overrides the file, so a secret can
stay out of it (`LUX_DATABASE_URL`, `LUX_S3_SECRET_KEY`). An unknown key or
a bad value stops luxd, naming it. luxd warns when others can read the
file: keep it `chmod 600`, or keep secrets in the environment.
[luxd.example.toml](luxd.example.toml) has every key with its default and
its variable; the table below lists them by variable.

`luxd [--config FILE] validate` checks a configuration the way `luxd serve`
does before it opens any connection, and connects to nothing, binds
nothing and writes nothing: the file and the environment are loaded
(unknown keys, types, values), `database.url` and `s3.bucket` must be set,
the database URL must parse, `s3.endpoint` and `s3.public_endpoint` (when
set) must be absolute http(s) URLs, `s3.region` must not be empty,
`s3.access_key` and `s3.secret_key` must be set together or not at all,
`listen` (and `preview.listen` when previews are on) must be `host:port`
with a numeric port 0–65535 or none (service names are refused; the host
is not resolved), and the console,
preview, cost-plugin, defaults, history and cost settings must be
consistent. It prints `ok: FILE` (or `ok: no file`) and exits 0; warnings
(a readable file, a retired key) go to stderr, naming the key, never a
value. On a refusal it prints what `serve` would and exits 1; extra
arguments exit 2. Not checked: whether the database and bucket are
reachable, and AWS shared config and credential sources, which the SDK
resolves when serve connects. It reads only local files: the
configuration, and any password, service or TLS files the database URL
names. A named pipe there would block it, so a caller should still run it
under a timeout. `luxd check-config` is an alias of `validate`.

| Variable | Default | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LUX_DATABASE_URL` | — | For `serve`, a DSN for the `lux_app` role; for `migrate`, the owner's. One file can serve both: set this variable per command. |
| `LUX_APP_PASSWORD` | `lux_app` | `migrate` sets `lux_app`'s password to it, each run. Set your own. |
| `LUX_LISTEN` | `127.0.0.1:7070` | Address to serve on. |
| `LUX_PUBLIC_URL` | — | The URL clients use. Runners too, unless `LUX_RUNNER_URL` is set. |
| `LUX_RUNNER_URL` | = public_url | The URL runners dial, if different from `LUX_PUBLIC_URL` (a private IP such as `http://10.0.1.10:7070`, unreachable from outside the VPC). |
| `LUX_RUNNER_BIN_DIR` | `/usr/local/lib/lux/runner` | Runner binaries luxd serves and hashes (sha256) at startup, for self-update: `<dir>/linux-{arm64,amd64}/{lux-runner,lux-shim}`. A missing arch or file is simply not offered. |
| `LUX_S3_BUCKET` | — | Where snapshots, output and artifacts go. |
| `LUX_S3_ENDPOINT` | AWS | For MinIO and other S3-compatible stores (path-style). |
| `LUX_S3_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT` | = endpoint | The endpoint presigned URLs are signed for, if runners and clients reach S3 by another name. |
| `LUX_S3_REGION` | `us-east-1` | |
| `LUX_S3_ACCESS_KEY`, `LUX_S3_SECRET_KEY` | AWS chain | Only luxd holds S3 credentials. |
| `LUX_LEASE` | `30s` | A host that misses heartbeats this long is lost, along with its live placements. At least 3s. Runners heartbeat every third of it, and drop a connection that is silent for two of those. Time no luxd could hear them (every luxd stopped, frozen whole, or cut off from Postgres) is not held against them: nothing is lost for missed heartbeats during it, nor for a lease (plus 10s) after a luxd is back, so a running Run survives a deploy or an outage of any length, and a host that died meanwhile is lost soon after. Other timers (`LUX_LAUNCH_TIMEOUT`, `LUX_LOST_GRACE`) still count it. It is also how long a Run with secrets waits for a luxd that holds their values (after a restart, say) before it stops, to be resumed with them. |
| `LUX_TICK` | `1s` | Scheduler and reaper interval. |
| `LUX_DEFAULT_CPUS`, `LUX_DEFAULT_MEMORY`, `LUX_DEFAULT_DISK`, `LUX_DEFAULT_PIDS` | `2`, `8Gi`, `20Gi`, `1024` | Resources a Run gets when its spec sets none. |
| `LUX_PROVIDER_CHECK_EVERY` | `1m` | How often each EC2 pool's instances are listed (orphans terminated, vanished hosts written off). Mind the provider's API limits. |
| `LUX_LOST_GRACE` | `5m` | How long a lost provisioned host's instance is kept (a runner restart or a network blip is not a loss) before it is terminated. |
| `LUX_LISTING_LAG` | `1m` | How long after a launch EC2's listings may still miss an instance: until then a host missing from them is not written off. |
| `LUX_SCALE_DOWN_AFTER` | `10m` | How long a provisioned host stays idle before it is cordoned, then terminated once idle. |
| `LUX_LAUNCH_TIMEOUT` | `10m` | How long a launched host may take to register before it is terminated. |
| `LUX_OUTDATED_DRAIN_PERCENT` | `10` | Caps concurrent outdated-binaries drains per pool, as a percentage of its live hosts (at least 1 regardless). |
| `LUX_EC2_ENDPOINT` | AWS | Overrides the EC2 endpoint (tests). |
| `LUX_SAMPLE_EVERY` | `10s` | How often the system is sampled for history ([Operators](operators.md#history)). |
| `LUX_HISTORY_RAW` | `48h` | How long raw samples (hosts and placements: one per heartbeat) are kept. |
| `LUX_HISTORY_MINUTES` | `720h` | How long minute rollups are kept. |
| `LUX_HISTORY_HOURS` | `9600h` | How long hour rollups are kept. |
| `LUX_HISTORY_DISK_PATHS` | `/` | Directories on luxd's own machine whose filesystems (used, free, total) the operators' Overview charts, comma-separated (`history.disk_paths`, a list, in the file). A path that cannot be read is skipped and logged. An empty list (`[]`, or only commas such as `,`) tracks no filesystem. |
| `LUX_COSTS` | `true` | Run costs ([Costs](costs.md)): `false` stops the cost tick and the queue's drainer on this luxd. State changes still queue their Runs, for whichever luxd drains. |
| `LUX_COSTS_EVERY` | `2m` | The cost tick: every live Run's costs are evaluated once per interval, by one luxd. |
| `LUX_COSTS_DRAIN_EVERY` | `2s` | How often each luxd polls the cost queue, besides being woken by Run events. |
| `LUX_COSTS_BATCH` | `1000` | How many Runs one drain claims. |
| `LUX_COSTS_SETTLE` | `["10m","1h"]` | Increasing durations after a Run finishes, JSON array in the environment. Plugin-specific `settle` overrides this. |
| `LUX_COSTS_SETTLE_GIVE_UP` | `168h` | Stop retrying a failed source after seven days. |
| `LUX_COSTS_BACKOFF`, `LUX_COSTS_BACKOFF_MAX` | `10s`, `10m` | Retry delays for plugin failures. |
| `LUX_COSTS_DESCRIBE_EVERY` | `1h` | Refresh cost plugin descriptions. |
| `LUX_COSTS_PLUGINS` | `[]` | JSON array replacing the entire `[[costs.plugin]]` list from the file. |
| `LUX_COSTS_COMPUTE_EC2` | `true` | Price EC2 hosts using AWS on-demand and spot list prices. |
| `LUX_COSTS_PRICES_REFRESH` | `24h` | Refresh interval for the on-demand price cache. |
| `LUX_COSTS_PRICING_REGION` | `us-east-1` | AWS region for the Pricing API, independent of the host's region. |
| `LUX_PRICING_ENDPOINT` | AWS | Overrides the Pricing API endpoint (tests). |
| `LUX_DEBUG` | — | Debug logging. |
| `LUX_CONSOLE_AUTH` | `key` | How the console signs people in: `key` or `cloudflare-access` ([Operators](operators.md#signing-in)). |
| `LUX_CF_ACCESS_TEAM`, `LUX_CF_ACCESS_AUD` | — | For `cloudflare-access`: the Access team (`acme` or `acme.cloudflareaccess.com`) and the application's AUD tag. |
| `LUX_CF_ACCESS_OPERATORS` | — | Comma-separated explicit operator emails (TOML: `console.cloudflare_access.operators` list). Required in Access mode; matched case-insensitively against verified JWT email only. |
| `LUX_CF_ACCESS_DEFAULT_TENANT` | — | Existing tenant ID (preferred) or exact tenant name (e.g. `absmartly`) for non-operator Access users. Required in Access mode; missing tenants deny requests. |
| `LUX_CONFIG` | `/etc/lux/luxd.toml` | The configuration file. |

luxd also serves the operator console at `/` ([Operators](operators.md#the-console)).

Cost plugins are configured under `[[costs.plugin]]` (see
[the example](luxd.example.toml)). Each needs a unique `name` other than
`compute` and an HTTP(S) base `url`. A bearer token may be read from
`token_file` or from the variable named by `token_env`, never inline in the
configuration. Optional `timeout` defaults to 30s, `max_batch` to 200;
`settle` overrides the global schedule. Plain HTTP is accepted for loopback
and private IPs; public HTTP requires `insecure = true`. Prefer HTTPS for
any plugin outside the private network. `LUX_COSTS_PLUGINS` takes a JSON
array of objects with the same keys (including duration strings), for example
`[{"name":"ledger","url":"https://ledger.example","token_env":"LEDGER_TOKEN"}]`.

### Tenants, keys and quotas

```bash
luxd admin create-tenant --name acme [--max-runs N] [--max-hosts N] [--retention-days 30]
luxd admin create-key --tenant T --scopes read,run
luxd admin create-operator-key [--name N]       # every tenant: see docs/operators.md
luxd admin set-quota --tenant T [--max-runs N] [--max-hosts N] [--max-storage BYTES] [--retention-days N]
```

- `--max-runs`: Runs that are not stopped or finished. Checked when a Run
  is submitted or resumed.
- `--max-hosts`: the tenant's registered hosts. Checked when a host
  registers.
- `--max-storage`: bytes in snapshots, output and artifacts not yet
  deleted by retention. Checked when a Run is submitted or resumed.
- `--retention-days`: how long a finished Run's blobs are kept (default
  30). The Run and its events stay. Resuming a finished Run clears its
  finish time, so a live Run's snapshots are never deleted.

A request over quota gets HTTP 429, and the CLI exits with code 5.

## Where bytes live

Every placement ends with a **snapshot** of its state volumes, its
**output**, and its **artifacts**, all written to the host's disk. They
reach S3 in the background:

1. The runner uploads each blob with `PUT /runner/v1/blobs/{id}`. luxd streams
   it into S3 and verifies its sha256 on the way. Runners never hold S3
   credentials. A snapshot report is validated against its Run's blob
   records; a report that does not match is refused whole (a
   `snapshot.failed` event on the Run, which keeps its previous snapshot
   and is not resumed automatically, even when the same placement
   reported an accepted snapshot before). A redelivered report must match
   the recorded manifest, output and artifacts exactly. The Run's state
   reason says so; a resume starts it from that previous snapshot. A Run
   with no previous snapshot is not resumable (409 `no_snapshot`, and
   left out of `lux ls --resumable`) unless `--from-snapshot` names one.
   The runner deletes the refused snapshot's files instead of uploading
   them.
2. The host keeps its local copy, so a resume there moves nothing. It
   deletes the copy when:
   - luxd tells it the Run now runs elsewhere (from S3), or
   - the copy is older than the runner's `--host-ttl` (default 24h).

   A copy is never deleted before its upload finished.
3. A runner downloads a snapshot through a presigned S3 URL, valid for 15
   minutes: it asks `GET /runner/v1/blobs/{id}`, and luxd redirects it only
   for the volumes of the snapshot a Run placed on that host is restoring
   (recorded by the placement that took that snapshot).
   The assignment carries each volume's size and sha256 as luxd recorded
   them, and the runner checks what it restores against them. Artifacts are
   downloaded through luxd, which decompresses them (blobs are stored zstd)
   and sends the file with its length and sha256 (`X-Lux-SHA256`), so a
   download cut short is detected.
4. Retention deletes a finished Run's blobs from S3 after the tenant's
   `retention_days`.

Keys are `tenants/<tenant>/runs/<run>/<blob>`. Encrypt the bucket at rest
(SSE-KMS on AWS).

## Hosts

Host requirements:

- Linux with cgroup v2. The runner makes cgroups of its own under
  `/sys/fs/cgroup/lux.slice` for image builds (their process limit, and
  ending everything a cancelled build started), and enables the `pids`
  controller for them.
- Podman ≥ 5 with netavark, run rootful.
- A `containers` range in `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` (for
  `--userns=auto`), for example `containers:2147483647:2147483648`.
- Podman storage on the native `overlay` driver, not fuse-overlayfs.
  Image builds run in their own user namespace, and under fuse-overlayfs
  their `RUN` steps can't write to the image's root directory.
- Tested with Podman 5.8. The runner turns idmapped overlay mounts off for
  builds (`_CONTAINERS_OVERLAY_DISABLE_IDMAP`, containers/storage's only
  switch for it). Without that, a build's files are owned by host ids, and
  its image id depends on the uid range it happened to get. The e2e test
  `test_rebuilds_match_whatever_uid_range_they_get` catches a Podman
  upgrade that drops the switch: run it before upgrading hosts.
- nftables (the runner owns the `inet lux` table; see
  [egress](runspec.md#network-egress)).
- For nested containers, `lux-runner --nested` (or `LUX_NESTED=true`): the
  host needs `/dev/fuse` and `/dev/net/tun`. The runner then labels the host
  `nested=true`; that label cannot be set with `--label` or a host token.
  `LUX_NESTED` accepts only `true` or `false`; anything else stops the
  runner.

```bash
LUX_URL=https://luxd.example LUX_HOST_TOKEN=luxh_… lux-runner --name host-a
```

A static host set up from a stock distro image can instead run luxd's
bootstrap script, which checks the host requirements above, installs
whatever is missing, and installs `lux-runner` as a systemd service
(`GET /runner/v1/bootstrap.sh`, no auth: it carries no secret). It is a bash
script (`missing=()` arrays, `set -o pipefail`), so it must run under
`bash`, not piped into a bare `sh`, which is `dash` on Debian and Ubuntu
and silently fails on it; `sudo env` is required to pass the environment
through:

```bash
curl -fsS https://luxd.example/runner/v1/bootstrap.sh | sudo env \
  LUX_URL=https://luxd.example LUX_HOST_TOKEN=luxh_… LUX_HOST_NAME=host-a bash
```

| Flag | Default | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--name` | hostname | Unique within the tenant. |
| `--data-dir` | `/var/lib/lux` | Run state and local snapshot copies. |
| `--shim` | `/usr/local/bin/lux-shim` | The shim binary to mount into containers. |
| `--label k=v` | | Host labels, matched by `placement.requires` and `prefers`. Also `LUX_LABELS=k=v,…`. |
| `--max-runs`, `--cpus` | 16, all | Capacity offered to the scheduler. |
| `--memory` | MemTotal | The machine's gross memory, offered to the scheduler: Runs ask in these terms and get their share after headroom ([how](concepts.md#memory-the-hosts-terms-scaled-to-what-linux-sees)). An EC2 host luxd launches gets its instance type's memory. Also `LUX_RUNNER_MEMORY`. |
| `--memory-headroom` | 512 MiB | Bytes of MemTotal kept from Runs for the kernel and the host. Each Run's container gets `resources.memory × min(1, (MemTotal − headroom) / --memory)`. The runner refuses to start if it leaves nothing. Also `LUX_RUNNER_MEMORY_HEADROOM`. |
| `--disk` | not reserved | Bytes of disk the scheduler reserves Runs' `resources.disk` from. Without it, disk is not reserved (Runs still stop at their own limit). Set it to the space under `/var/lib/containers`, more to overcommit. |
| `--usage-every` | `15s` | How often each Run's disk use is sampled, and its disk limit checked. |
| `--host-ttl` | `24h` | How long uploaded local copies are kept, and images lux pulled or built after their last use ([images on hosts](runspec.md#images-on-hosts)). |
| `--image-disk-high` | `80` | Percent use of the disk holding Podman's storage (its graph root, `/var/lib/containers`) over which lux's unused images are removed, least recently used first, until under it. `0` turns it off. Images the host had before lux are never removed. |
| `--provider-id` | | The cloud instance id, for provisioned hosts. Also `LUX_PROVIDER_ID`. |
| `--ec2-imds` | off | EC2 instance metadata URL (`http://169.254.169.254`) to watch for spot interruptions. Also `LUX_EC2_IMDS`. |
| `--poll` | off | Use HTTP polling instead of a WebSocket. There is no live output in this mode: output arrives after exit. |

Private registries ([`image.registryAuth`](runspec.md#private-registries))
should be HTTPS. For a plain-HTTP registry (a test or air-gapped one),
list it as insecure on every host:

```bash
cat > /etc/containers/registries.conf.d/50-internal.conf <<'EOF'
[[registry]]
location = "10.0.0.5:5000"
insecure = true
EOF
```

Host tokens come from `luxd admin create-host-token --tenant T [--pool P]
[--label k=v]`. Restarting `lux-runner` does not touch running containers
(Podman is daemonless). The new runner re-adopts them.

### Binary distribution and self-update

luxd serves the runner binaries a host needs, so no custom AMI or
config-management run has to carry them:

- `GET /runner/v1/bin/manifest` (host-token auth): `{"linux-arm64":
  {"lux-runner": "<sha256>", "lux-shim": "<sha256>"}, "linux-amd64": {...}}`
  for each arch `LUX_RUNNER_BIN_DIR` holds **both** binaries for; an arch
  missing either file is never listed, and never grounds for a drain (luxd
  never asks a host to update to something it cannot itself serve).
- `GET /runner/v1/bin/linux-{arch}/{lux-runner|lux-shim}` streams the binary,
  with `Content-Length` and its sha256 in `X-Lux-Sha256`.

luxd hashes what it finds under `LUX_RUNNER_BIN_DIR` once at startup. A
host downloads its arch's binaries before starting `lux-runner` (its
systemd unit's `ExecStartPre`), so an upgrade is: replace luxd's
`runner_bin_dir`, restart luxd, then restart or replace each host — never
patch a running binary in place. **Every luxd instance behind the same
`runner_url` must serve identical runner binaries before a rolling
deploy**: otherwise which luxd a host's next heartbeat happens to reach
decides whether it is "outdated", and `/runner/v1/bin` can serve a different
build to a host mid-update.

Every `Hello` and `Heartbeat` a runner sends carries the sha256 of its own
binary (`os.Executable()`) and of its `--shim`; older runners simply omit
them. When luxd holds both binaries for that host's arch and either sha
differs, and the host is not already draining, it cordons the host once,
recording an `outdated` cause (`hosts.drain_causes`; no Run is stopped,
and at most `LUX_OUTDATED_DRAIN_PERCENT`% of a pool's live hosts, at
least one, cordon at a time — enforced under a per-pool lock, so a burst
of Hellos after a luxd restart cannot overshoot it). `state_reason` is display text
only, shown as `outdated binaries` while that is the most recent cause set,
but never read back by luxd itself. A cordoned **provisioned** host stops
taking new Runs; once its existing ones finish and it goes idle it is
terminated same as any other drain, and the pool launches a fresh one with
the running luxd's binaries. A cordoned **static** host keeps its Runs;
once none are left and it has nothing left to upload, luxd asks it to
exit: its systemd unit's `Restart=always` brings it back, and its
`ExecStartPre` re-downloads the binaries first. If that exit goes
unacknowledged for 10 minutes and the host is still outdated and idle,
the reaper sends it again (logged each time). A `Hello` reporting matching
binaries removes only the `outdated` cause, in the same transaction that
acks any exit still queued for it; the host stays draining if another
cause remains (an operator's `lux hosts drain`, or `pools rm`) — an
operator's drain always outranks a release, so a host also carrying a
manual cause is left alone by the reaper too: it updates only once the
operator undrains it, or restarts it by hand. A runner ignores a
redelivered `exit` if its binaries already match what luxd's manifest
last showed, or if it holds live placements (logged either way).

A host installs the downloaded `lux-runner`, `lux-shim` and the fetch
script itself under `/usr/local/bin`, not under `/usr/local/lib` — Fedora
CoreOS enforces SELinux, and its default policy labels `/usr/local/bin`
`bin_t` (systemd's `ExecStart` can run it) but leaves `/usr/local/lib`
unlabeled, which fails with `203/EXEC`. This is unrelated to
`runner_bin_dir` on luxd's own host, which is unchanged.

## Pools and the default pool

A Run goes to the pool its spec names (`placement.pool`). One that names
none goes to its tenant's **default pool**, which a tenant (or an operator)
chooses by marking one of its pools:

```bash
lux pools set arm64 --default          # the tenant's default from now on
lux pools set arm64 --default=false    # no default: the platform's, else "default"
luxd admin create-pool --name shared-x86 --provider static --shared --default   # the platform's default
```

luxd picks the pool when the Run is submitted, in this order:

1. the tenant's default pool;
2. else the platform's default pool (a platform pool, `tenant_id` NULL,
   marked by an operator: `lux pools set <name> --default` without
   `--tenant`, or `luxd admin create-pool --default`);
3. else the pool named `default`, which is what every such Run got before
   default pools existed. A deployment with a pool named `default` keeps
   working without marking anything.

The pool is written into the Run's spec, so its resumes, retries and
migrations stay there even when the default changes later. The Run's
`submitted` event says which pool and why: `{"pool": "arm64", "poolFrom":
"tenant-default", "poolOwner": "tenant"}` (`platform-default`, `fallback`,
or `spec` when the spec named it). A Run that names a pool, `default`
included, is never redirected.

A tenant pool and a platform pool may share a name, so luxd records whose
pool it is too (`runs.pool_owner`; `poolOwner` in the event): the default's
owner, or for a name, the tenant's own pool of that name, else the
platform's. The Run then goes only to that owner's hosts, and only that
pool provisions for it. A name no pool has (static hosts that joined by
host token with a pool name no pool was created for) records no owner, and
such Runs, like those submitted before this was recorded, match hosts by
name as before. If the Run's pool is removed, it waits ("its pool burst
was removed") rather than taking another owner's pool of that name, or
that pool's static hosts, which `lux pools rm` leaves in service for Runs
without an owner; re-creating the pool serves it again.

A tenant has at most one default pool, and the platform one (Postgres
refuses a second). Marking another pool moves the mark in one statement.
`lux pools rm` clears the mark of the pool it removes; re-creating that
pool does not bring it back. Upgrading marks no pool.

## EC2 pools

Pool names follow the rule in [the CLI reference](cli.md#hosts-and-pools): 1-32
lowercase letters, digits and `-`. `luxd admin create-pool` and
`create-host-token --pool` apply it too.

A pool with `provider: ec2` is sized by luxd:

```bash
lux pools set burst --provider ec2 --min 0 --max 10 --warm 1 \
  --template '{"region":"eu-west-1","launchTemplate":"lux-runner","instanceType":"m7i.2xlarge","subnets":["subnet-a","subnet-b"]}'
lux pools rm burst      # cordons its hosts; each is terminated once idle
lux pools rm burst --force-evict   # also stops its hosts' live Runs, so they resume elsewhere at once
```

- **Scale up:** when Runs for the pool wait in `provisioning`, luxd launches
  the hosts they need beyond what ready and starting hosts can hold, sized
  from the capacity its registered hosts reported
  ([capacity planning](telemetry.md#capacity-planning)), plus `--warm` idle
  ones kept ready. It keeps at
  least `--min` hosts and never more than `--max`. Launches alternate
  across the template's subnets.
- **Scale down:** a host idle longer than the pool's `--scale-down-after`
  (default `LUX_SCALE_DOWN_AFTER`, 10m), above the minimum and warm count,
  is cordoned. It is terminated once
  it has no live placements and nothing left to upload. `lux pools rm`
  cordons the pool's hosts the same way, without `--force-evict`: a Run on
  one finishes where it is and the host is terminated once idle; with
  `--force-evict` it is stopped (snapshotted) and resumed elsewhere at once,
  never cut short.
- **Scale to zero when idle:** `--warm-while-active` keeps the `--warm`
  hosts only while the pool is in use: a Run live on it, or placed or
  ended within its `--scale-down-after`. After that the pool drops to
  `--min`. With `--min 0 --warm 1 --warm-while-active --scale-down-after
  600s`, someone working keeps a host ready between Runs, and ten quiet
  minutes after the last one the pool has no hosts at all:

  ```bash
  lux pools set burst --provider ec2 --template '…' \
    --min 0 --max 10 --warm 1 --warm-while-active --scale-down-after 600s
  ```

  Without it, `--warm` hosts are kept at all times.
- **Failures:** a launch that fails is retried on the next pass. A host
  that never registers within `LUX_LAUNCH_TIMEOUT` (default 10m) is
  terminated. An instance EC2 no longer has is written off and replaced.
- **Orphans:** once a minute luxd lists the pool's instances by tag. One
  no host row claims (a launch whose reply was lost) is terminated; a host
  EC2 no longer lists (and whose runner is silent) is terminated and
  written off. A host lost for over 5 minutes is
  terminated.
- One luxd instance does all this at a time (a lease in Postgres).

### Spot instances

Add `"spot": true` to the template to launch one-time spot instances:

```bash
lux pools set burst --provider ec2 --max 10 \
  --template '{"region":"eu-west-1","launchTemplate":"lux-runner","spot":true}'
```

EC2 gives two minutes' notice before it takes a spot instance back. Each
instance's runner watches for it (user data sets `LUX_EC2_IMDS`, which the
runner reads as `--ec2-imds`; IMDSv2 must be reachable). On the notice:

1. The runner tells luxd, which drains the host: nothing new is placed on
   it, and each of its Runs is asked to stop with reason `preempt`.
2. Stops from then on get a grace of at most half the time left, so the
   Run has time to snapshot its state volumes and upload them.
3. Each preempted Run is resumed automatically from that snapshot, on
   another host. If the pool has none free it launches one. An agent picks
   its session back up, as after any resume.

A Run whose stop or upload cannot finish in time (a very large state
volume) is lost when the instance goes. It is resumable from its previous
snapshot. Keep state volumes small on spot pools, or use on-demand for
Runs that cannot afford it (`placement.pool`).

What an instance needs:

- **No custom AMI.** A launch template with **no user data** (luxd's own
  replaces it on every `RunInstances`) and one of:
  - a stock **Fedora CoreOS** AMI (the default; see `userData` below) —
    nothing is installed at boot, so a host registers in under a minute;
  - a stock **Fedora Cloud, Ubuntu, Debian or AL2023** AMI with
    `"userData": "script"` — cloud-init runs a script that installs only
    what is missing (podman, nftables, git; `dnf` or `apt-get`);
  - any AMI already carrying `lux-runner`/`lux-shim` and its own boot
    script, with `"userData": "env"` (the pre-self-update behaviour: plain
    `KEY=value` lines).

  Whichever format, the instance downloads `lux-runner` and `lux-shim` from
  luxd itself (`GET /runner/v1/bin/...`, verified by sha256) rather than
  carrying them in the AMI, so a new release needs no new AMI.
- A launch template (id `lt-…` or name), a security group reaching
  `runner_url`, egress to the package mirrors (the `script` format) and to
  wherever images, git remotes and model APIs live, and an instance
  profile if the runner needs one (it doesn't hold S3 credentials).
- luxd needs EC2 permissions for `RunInstances` (with the launch template
  and `CreateTags`), `TerminateInstances`, `DescribeInstances` and
  `DescribeInstanceTypes` (a template's `instanceType`'s memory, passed to
  the runner as `LUX_RUNNER_MEMORY`; without it the launch still goes
  ahead, logged, and the host offers its MemTotal), plus
  `pricing:GetProducts` for on-demand prices and
  `ec2:DescribeSpotPriceHistory` for spot prices, from its standard AWS
  configuration (environment or instance role). Both pricing actions are
  read-only and require `Resource: "*"`; the runner needs neither. The
  Pricing API uses `LUX_COSTS_PRICING_REGION` regardless of the host's
  region. `LUX_EC2_ENDPOINT` and `LUX_PRICING_ENDPOINT` override their
  respective endpoints for tests.

`template.userData` picks the format (default `"ignition"`); a pool set
with an unrecognized value is refused, not left to fail at boot:

| Value | What it is | When to use it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ignition` (default) | An Ignition v3.4.0 config for Fedora CoreOS. | The default: no packages to install, fastest boot. |
| `script` | A `#!/bin/bash` script cloud-init runs. | A stock Fedora Cloud, Ubuntu, Debian or AL2023 AMI. |
| `env` | Plain `KEY=value` lines (`LUX_URL`, `LUX_HOST_TOKEN`, `LUX_HOST_NAME`, `LUX_EC2_IMDS`, `LUX_RUNNER_MEMORY` when luxd knows the instance type's memory, and `LUX_NESTED` for a nested pool). | A custom AMI with its own boot script, from before self-update. |

### Nested containers on an EC2 pool

`"nestedContainers": true` in an ec2 template starts every host the pool
launches from then on with `lux-runner --nested`: user data sets
`LUX_NESTED=true` in `/etc/lux/runner.env` (every format, including
`env`, whose own boot script must pass it on). It is off by default, a
JSON boolean (anything else is refused when the pool is set), and only for
ec2 pools: a static host offers nested containers with its own flag.

```bash
lux pools set burst --provider ec2 --max 10 \
  --template '{"region":"eu-west-1","launchTemplate":"lux-runner","nestedContainers":true}'
```

- The AMI must provide `/dev/fuse` and `/dev/net/tun` (Fedora CoreOS does).
  A runner without them exits instead of registering, so a wrong AMI shows
  as launches that never become ready rather than nested Runs placed on
  hosts that cannot run them.
- Capacity planning counts a future host as nested-capable only when the
  current template opts in, never from the labels of hosts launched
  earlier. A Run with `sandbox.nestedContainers` on a pool without it waits
  with "host does not support nested containers" and launches nothing.
- Once the two newest hosts of the current template register without
  nested containers (or the only one so far does: an `env`-format AMI that
  does not pass `LUX_NESTED` on, say), nested Runs stop counting on its
  future hosts: they wait with "current template's hosts registered without
  nested containers", and only a Run that began waiting after the last
  registration launches one probe host. One host without nesting after a
  nested one does not stop nested launches. A nested host registering last
  (a slow launch from before the change) resumes them for at most one
  burst (plus one host if that burst's hosts register one at a time), and
  its first two hosts without nesting stop them again. Fix the AMI or
  launch template and edit the pool template to plan afresh.
- Hosts that already run keep what they registered with. Changing the
  template is a new template, so the pool scales on it as for any template
  edit; replace (drain) existing hosts to apply it to them.

Every format's token is single-use per host and revoked when the host is
terminated. A static host (outside any pool) uses the same script as
`userData: script`, unfilled: `curl <luxd>/runner/v1/bootstrap.sh | sudo env
LUX_HOST_TOKEN=luxh_… LUX_URL=https://luxd.example bash` (no auth on that
endpoint: it carries no secret, only how to reach luxd).

Instances are tagged `Name=<host>`, `lux:pool-id=<pool id>`,
`lux:pool=<pool name at launch>`, `lux:managed=true`,
`lux:deployment=<id>` (which lux database launched it: deployments sharing
an account never touch each other's instances) and `lux:host=<host id>`,
plus the template's `tags`. luxd lists a pool's instances by
`lux:pool-id`, `lux:managed` and `lux:deployment` (`DescribeInstances`
filtered by tag), never by name: renaming a pool (`lux pools rename`) is a
database change, and its instances keep running and stay its own.
`lux:pool` is informational and not updated by a rename. All tags are set
at launch; luxd tags nothing afterwards.

Reusable Terraform for running all of this on AWS — control host, S3,
runner launch templates, Cloudflare Tunnel — is under
[deploy/terraform/](../deploy/terraform/README.md).
