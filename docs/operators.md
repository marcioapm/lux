# Operators and the console

An operator runs lux for everyone. An **operator key** belongs to no tenant:
it sees every tenant's Runs, hosts and pools, and can act on any of them.
Everything an operator does goes through the same API and CLI as tenants;
the console is a view of that API in a browser.

## Operator keys

```bash
luxd admin create-operator-key [--name alice]    # → {"apiKey": "lux_…"}
```

Only `luxd admin` makes them, never the API. The `operator` scope implies
`admin`, `run` and `read`. Tenant keys, even `admin` ones, never see another
tenant's rows: that is still enforced by Postgres row-level security, and an
operator's request on a Run runs in that Run's tenant's scope.

## One tenant, or all of them

Without `--tenant`, an operator sees every tenant, and lists show a TENANT
column. `--tenant <id or name>` (env `LUX_TENANT`, `?tenant=` in the API)
narrows every command to one tenant and shows what that tenant would see.
Tenant keys ignore it.

A Run's own commands (`get`, `logs`, `stop`, `resume`…) need no `--tenant`:
luxd finds the Run's tenant. Commands that create something for a tenant
(`lux run`, `lux pools set`) need one.

## Looking

```bash
lux status                          # Runs by state, busy/idle, queue, time to start, hosts, capacity
lux ls [--resumable] [--host H] [--state …] [--limit N]
lux get <run>                       # with what a resume would take, when stopped, lost or failed
lux hosts ls [--pool P] [--state S] [--all]
lux hosts get <host>                # lifecycle, capacity, what its live placements hold
lux tenants ls                      # quotas and what each tenant uses
lux history [--since 24h]           # the system over time (sparklines; -o json for the samples)
lux history <run>                   # a Run's CPU, memory, disk, pids, network, across placements
lux history --host <host>
lux events --all [--after ID] [--follow=false]   # every Run's events, as they happen
```

On a platform host (shared by tenants), a tenant sees its own placements and
what they hold, never another tenant's; the host's history is the
operators'.

A host is named by id or name. Two tenants may each have a host of the
same name; an operator then names it by id, or with `--tenant`.

## Acting

```bash
lux hosts drain <host> [--force-evict]          # no new Runs; --force-evict also moves its Runs elsewhere
lux stop <run> / lux cancel <run>
lux migrate <run> [--to HOST] [--input TEXT] [--wait]
lux resume <run> [--to HOST] [--from-snapshot S] [--input TEXT]
```

**Migrate** moves a running Run: it is stopped (its state volumes
snapshotted, as on any stop), then resumed at once on `--to`, or anywhere
but the host it was on (if no other host can take it, it goes back there
rather than wait). It is the path a force-evict drain takes, for one Run. An
agent resumes its session, so it has its whole conversation; if it was in
the middle of a turn, that turn was interrupted. Nothing is said to it
unless `--input` is given: that text is delivered once it runs again ("go
on where you left off", say). A generic workload restarts its command with
its state volumes restored.

A Run already being stopped (by its tenant, a drain, a cancel) cannot also
be migrated. A tenant's `stop` during a migration wins: the Run stays
stopped. A chosen host that stops taking Runs (drained, lost) before the Run
gets there no longer holds it: it goes wherever it may.

**Resume** by an operator can choose the host (`--to`). A Run's secrets are
never stored: luxd holds their values in memory from the submit or resume
that supplied them. While it still does (it has not restarted since), an
operator resumes the Run without them; otherwise only the tenant can, by
supplying them again. `lux get` says which (`secrets: … held by luxd`).

A chosen host (`--to`) must be ready, not draining, and one the Run's tenant
may use; the Run still needs room there. It may be outside the Run's pool
or labels: the operator's choice wins over the spec's placement.

## History

luxd keeps samples of:

- every host, on each heartbeat: CPU in use, memory in use, disk used on
  the runner's data filesystem, and its live placements and what they asked
  for;
- every live placement, on each heartbeat: CPU, memory and pids now, disk,
  and network counters;
- the system, every `LUX_SAMPLE_EVERY`, once in total and once per tenant:
  Runs by state, busy and idle, the queue, Runs started and finished, time
  to start (p50, p95), hosts by state, capacity and what is allocated.

Raw samples are rolled up into minutes and hours; each resolution is kept
for its own period (see [Operations](operations.md)). A read picks the
finest resolution that still covers its range. Counters (CPU seconds,
network bytes) are served as rates.

## The console

luxd serves a web console at `/console/`, the same origin as the API. It
shows what its user can see: an operator the whole system, with a tenant
filter at the top; a tenant key, that tenant.

- **Overview**: status now, history charts over the chosen range, and a live
  feed of every Run's events.
- **Runs**: filterable, with a Run page per Run: output (live), placement
  timeline, resource charts, events, snapshots and artifacts, and the
  actions above.
- **Hosts**: capacity and allocation, and a host page with its history,
  lifecycle and the Runs on it.
- **Pools** and **Tenants**.

The console is static files built with Bun and embedded in luxd (see
[Development](development.md)). Reach it like the API: through the tunnel
or load balancer you already use for luxd.

### Signing in

`console.auth` (`LUX_CONSOLE_AUTH`) says how:

- **`key`** (the default): the console asks for an API key, kept for the
  browser tab's session only.
- **`cloudflare-access`**: luxd sits behind a Cloudflare Access
  application, and whoever Access lets in is an operator; the console
  shows their name, and their actions are recorded as their email. Set
  `console.cloudflare_access.team` and `.aud` (the application's AUD tag,
  on its Overview page). luxd verifies every Access token itself (the
  `Cf-Access-Jwt-Assertion` header or `CF_Authorization` cookie: signed by
  the team's keys, for this application, not expired), so a request that
  reaches luxd around Access gets nothing without a key. Access policies
  decide who is an operator: keep the application's policy to the people
  who should be (a policy letting in anyone with an email makes everyone an
  operator). API keys still work alongside (the CLI, runners). The Access
  cookie authenticates reads and requests from the console itself; a form
  or script on another site cannot act with it (writes need the browser to
  mark them same-origin, `Sec-Fetch-Site`; every current browser does).
  Service tokens carry no email and are refused. The top bar shows who is
  signed in; clicking the name signs out of Access
  (`/cdn-cgi/access/logout`). In key mode, "Sign out" forgets the key.

  With a tunnel (`cloudflared`), `originRequest.access.required` can also
  refuse unauthenticated requests before they reach luxd.

Other ways to sign in can be added as further `console.auth` values.

### What only operators can do

`lux tenants ls`, `lux migrate`, choosing a host (`resume --to`), and
resuming without supplying secrets. Tenants and keys are made with `luxd
admin` only, never through the API, by operators or anyone.
