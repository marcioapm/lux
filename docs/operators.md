# Operators and the console

An operator runs lux for everyone. An **operator key** belongs to no tenant:
it sees every tenant's Runs, hosts and pools, and can act on any of them.
Everything an operator does goes through the same API and CLI as tenants;
the console is a view of that API in a browser.

## Operator keys

```bash
luxd admin create-operator-key [--name alice]    # → {"apiKey": "lux_…"}
```

Only `luxd admin` makes them, never the API. The `operator` scope implies
`admin`, `run` and `read`. Tenant keys, even `admin` ones, never see another
tenant's rows: that is still enforced by Postgres row-level security, and an
operator's request on a Run runs in that Run's tenant's scope.

## One tenant, or all of them

With no tenant from the flag, the environment or the config file, an
operator sees every tenant, and lists show a TENANT column.
`--tenant <id or name>` (env `LUX_TENANT`, `tenant` in
`~/.config/lux/config.toml`, `?tenant=` in the API)
narrows every command to one tenant and shows what that tenant would see.
Tenant keys ignore it. With a default tenant in the config file,
`--tenant ""` (or `LUX_TENANT=`) reaches all tenants again.

A Run's own commands (`get`, `logs`, `stop`, `resume`…) need no `--tenant`:
luxd finds the Run's tenant. Commands that create something for a tenant
(`lux run`, `lux pools set`) need one.

## Looking

```bash
lux status                          # Runs by state, busy/idle, queue, time to start, hosts, capacity
lux ls [--resumable] [--host H] [--state …] [--limit N]
lux get <run>                       # with what a resume would take, when stopped, lost, failed or succeeded
lux hosts ls [--pool P] [--state S] [--all]
lux hosts get <host>                # lifecycle, capacity, what its live placements hold
lux tenants ls                      # quotas and what each tenant uses; RETENTION, and EXPIRY (never: resting Runs are never terminated)
lux history [--since 24h]           # the system over time (sparklines; -o json for the samples)
lux history <run>                   # a Run's CPU, memory, disk, pids, network, across placements
lux history --host <host>
lux events --all [--after ID] [--follow=false]   # every Run's events, as they happen
```

On a platform host (shared by tenants), a tenant sees its own placements and
what they hold, never another tenant's; the host's history is the
operators'.

A host is named by id or name. Two tenants may each have a host of the
same name; an operator then names it by id, or with `--tenant`.

Why an EC2 pool launched a host, or did not, is in its events: `lux pools
events <pool>` shows each `pool.scale_up` with its capacity plan (Runs
covered by ready, starting and planned hosts, those unmet or blocked, the
new-host capacity it assumed and sampled blockers), and `lux hosts events
<host>` shows `host.capacity_decision` when the planner's verdict on that
host changes. The console's pool and host pages show the same lines. See
[Telemetry](telemetry.md#capacity-planning) for what each field means.
A pass that launches nothing while hosts are wanted or Runs stay unmet
writes `pool.scale_blocked` with its cause (`--max`, the tenant's host
quota, no new host fits, or a launch backoff after failed launches) and
the same plan, once per stuck state. A launch backoff is instead counted
per waiting pass, folded best-effort into one row: a long backoff with
many differing launch errors can start a new row.

The capacity a new host is expected to have comes from the latest 8 hosts
that registered from the pool's exact current template. Moving the EC2
launch template's `$Default` to another instance type does not change the
pool's template, so the old observations age out as 8 new hosts register;
a Run too large for the old size gets one probe host meanwhile. Editing
the pool's template (`lux pools set`) starts from no observations at once:
the pool launches one host to learn the new capacity.

## Acting

```bash
lux hosts drain <host> [--force-evict]          # no new Runs; --force-evict also moves its Runs elsewhere (resumePolicy manual: fails them; never: terminates them)
lux stop <run> / lux terminate <run>
lux migrate <run> [--to HOST] [--input TEXT] [--wait]
lux resume <run> [--to HOST] [--from-snapshot S] [--input TEXT]
```

**Migrate** moves a running Run: it is stopped (its state volumes
snapshotted, as on any stop), then resumed at once on `--to`, or anywhere
but the host it was on (if no other host can take it, it goes back there
rather than wait). It is the path a force-evict drain takes, for one Run. An
agent resumes its session, so it has its whole conversation; if it was in
the middle of a turn, that turn was interrupted. Nothing is said to it
unless `--input` is given: that text is delivered once it runs again ("go
on where you left off", say). A generic workload restarts its command with
its state volumes restored.

A Run already being stopped (by its tenant, a force-evict drain, a terminate)
cannot also be migrated. A Run on a host that is merely cordoned (a plain
drain, scale-down, `pools rm`) is not being stopped by that alone, so
migrate still applies to it. A tenant's `stop` during a migration wins: the
Run stays stopped. A chosen host that stops taking Runs (drained, lost)
before the Run gets there no longer holds it: it goes wherever it may.

A Run's `resumePolicy` ([resume policy](runspec.md#resume-policy)) changes
what a move does to it:

- `restart`: migrate and force-evict start it again from scratch on the
  new host (empty state volumes, no session), not from its snapshot.
- `manual` or `never` (one-shot work that cannot continue elsewhere): it
  cannot be migrated (409 `not_movable`), and it keeps running. A
  force-evict drain or `pools rm --force-evict` still stops it, and it then
  ends: `manual` `failed`, `never` `terminated` (`drain: not resumed
  (resumePolicy never)`). To let it finish, drain without `--force-evict`.
- `never` can never be resumed: any end that would leave it resumable
  terminates it, and a requested resume of one still resting from an
  older luxd is refused, an operator's included (409 `not_resumable`). An
  assignment no runner started may still be placed again.

**Resume** by an operator can choose the host (`--to`). A Run's secrets are
never stored: luxd holds their values in memory from the submit or resume
that supplied them. While it still does (it has not restarted since), an
operator resumes the Run without them; otherwise only the tenant can, by
supplying them again. `lux get` says which (`secrets: … held by luxd`).

A chosen host (`--to`) must be ready, not draining, and one the Run's tenant
may use; the Run still needs room there. It may be outside the Run's pool
or labels: the operator's choice wins over the spec's placement.

## History

luxd keeps samples of:

- every host, on each heartbeat: CPU in use, memory in use, disk used on
  the runner's data filesystem, and its live placements and what they asked
  for; and the runner process's own CPU, memory (RSS, its peak since the
  last heartbeat, Go heap) and goroutines, with when it started, so a
  restart shows;
- every live placement, on each heartbeat: CPU, memory and pids now, disk,
  and network counters;
- the system, every `LUX_SAMPLE_EVERY`, once in total and once per tenant:
  Runs by state, busy and idle, the queue, Runs started and finished, time
  to start (p50, p95), hosts by state, capacity and what is allocated, and
  the bytes kept in S3 by kind (snapshots, output, artifacts, build
  contexts; [Telemetry](telemetry.md#history)).
- the control host, the machine luxd itself runs on, with the system: CPU
  and memory used against what it has, each tracked filesystem's used and
  free space (`history.disk_paths`, `LUX_HISTORY_DISK_PATHS`; default `/`;
  a path that cannot be read is skipped and logged), its Postgres
  database's size and connections, and the luxd process's own use (as a
  runner's, above). Only operators viewing all tenants see
  it. The charts draw a line per machine (by hostname) and one for
  Postgres, and a line per luxd process, named by its machine and the tail
  of its id: several luxd instances, or a restart, are separate lines.

Raw samples are rolled up into minutes and hours; each resolution is kept
for its own period (see [Operations](operations.md)). A read picks the
finest resolution that still covers its range. Counters (CPU seconds,
network bytes) are served as rates.

## The console

luxd serves a web console at `/`, the same origin as the API (every path
outside `/v1/` and `/runner/`; old `/console/...` links redirect). It
shows what its user can see: an operator the whole system, with a tenant
filter at the top; a tenant key, that tenant.

- **Overview**: status now, history charts over the chosen range, and a live
  feed of every Run's events. An operator viewing all tenants also gets a
  **Control host** row: luxd's machine (CPU, memory, one disk card per
  tracked path), its Postgres (size, connections), and luxd itself (CPU,
  memory, goroutines), a line per luxd process. A host page charts its
  runner the same way, a line per runner process.
- **Runs**: filterable, with each Run's runtime (live while it runs) and
  placements (see [Concepts](concepts.md#placement-and-epoch)), and a Run
  page per Run: output (live), placement timeline, resource charts,
  events, snapshots and artifacts, and the actions above.
- **Hosts**: capacity and allocation, and a host page with its history
  (the runner process's too), lifecycle and the Runs on it.
- **Pools** and **Tenants**.

The console is static files built with Bun and embedded in luxd (see
[Development](development.md)). Reach it like the API: through the tunnel
or load balancer you already use for luxd.

### Signing in

`console.auth` (`LUX_CONSOLE_AUTH`) says how:

- **`key`** (the default): the console asks for an API key, kept for the
  browser tab's session only. After luxd accepts the key, the page reloads
  into the console, removing password-manager UI attached to the form
  (such as Bitwarden's inline menu).
- **`cloudflare-access`**: luxd sits behind a Cloudflare Access
  application. Configure `console.cloudflare_access.team`, `.aud`,
  `.operators` (an explicit list of operator email addresses), and
  `.default_tenant` (an existing tenant ID, preferred, or exact name such as
  `absmartly`). Missing or invalid settings prevent startup. Only an email
  in the verified Access JWT can match the operator allowlist; matching is
  case-insensitive. Every other Access user with a valid email is an `admin`
  principal confined to the default tenant, including when `?tenant=` names
  another tenant. An absent default tenant denies their requests; it never
  promotes them to operator. Create the tenant and verify its ID before
  enabling this mode. Keep Access policies restrictive as the default tenant
  grants Run and admin operations to every admitted user. Never put personal
  addresses in a public config example; keep the actual allowlist in private
  deployment configuration. luxd verifies tokens (header or cookie): team
  signature, issuer, audience and expiry. API keys still work alongside.
  The Access cookie authenticates reads and same-origin writes only
  (`Sec-Fetch-Site`). Service tokens without email are refused. Actions are
  recorded as the JWT email. The foot of the sidebar shows who is signed
  in, with a button to sign out of Access (`/cdn-cgi/access/logout`). Their
  photo comes from the identity provider's `picture` claim: in Zero Trust,
  add `picture` under the identity provider's OIDC claims (and make sure it
  requests the `profile` scope); luxd reads it from Access's identity
  endpoint (`oidc_fields.picture`, https URLs only). Without one, the
  sidebar shows initials. In key mode, "Sign out" forgets the key.

  With a tunnel (`cloudflared`), `originRequest.access.required` can also
  refuse unauthenticated requests before they reach luxd.

Other ways to sign in can be added as further `console.auth` values.

### Previews

luxd can serve servers ([concepts](concepts.md#servers)) at
`https://<hostname>`, a name under its preview domain
(`web-k3x9ab2c.lux.example.com`, or one their owner chose:
`web.t123.p9.lux.example.com`; [concepts](concepts.md#servers) has the
rules). It reaches the server wherever its Run is now, through a listener
of luxd's own that only ever proxies:

```toml
[preview]
domain = "lux.example.com"       # LUX_PREVIEW_DOMAIN; empty: off (servers' url is null)
listen = "127.0.0.1:7071"        # LUX_PREVIEW_LISTEN
auth = ""                        # LUX_PREVIEW_AUTH: cloudflare-access | ticket; empty: as the console
hold_for = "20s"                 # LUX_PREVIEW_HOLD_FOR (servers that do not wake on request)
scheme = "https"                 # LUX_PREVIEW_SCHEME: http only for a domain under localhost
public_port = 0                  # LUX_PREVIEW_PUBLIC_PORT: the port in preview URLs (0: the scheme's)
activity_every = "30s"           # LUX_PREVIEW_ACTIVITY_EVERY: lastRequestAt writes (idle precision)
idle_check = "5s"                # LUX_PREVIEW_IDLE_CHECK: how often idle and expired servers are looked for
[preview.cloudflare_access]
aud = ""                         # LUX_PREVIEW_CF_ACCESS_AUD (team: console.cloudflare_access.team)
```

**Preview URLs changed once.** Before servers were their own resources, a
server's URL was `<name>-<run suffix>.<domain>`, and changed whenever its
Run did. Since migration 049 it is the server's own, stable for its life;
an existing server's URL changed once, to `<name>-<8 of its id>.<domain>`,
and the old one answers "This preview is gone". Preview cookies and
tickets are per server: a browser signs in once per server.

- **DNS and TLS:** a wildcard to the listener for every level owners use:
  `*.<domain>`, and `*.*.<domain>` if they choose deeper names (with the
  Cloudflare tunnel, `deploy/terraform/cloudflare` makes the record, the
  ingress rule and, with `preview_certificate_pack`, the certificate:
  Universal SSL does not cover `*.lux.example.com`, and an advanced
  certificate covers one level per wildcard).
- **Auth, `cloudflare-access`:** an Access application on `*.<domain>`
  (the terraform module's `preview_access_*`) whose AUD is
  `preview.cloudflare_access.aud`. luxd verifies the token itself and lets
  in operators and the default tenant's users for that tenant's servers,
  as the console does. Needs `console.auth = "cloudflare-access"`.
- **Auth, `ticket`** (the default in key mode): a browser without a
  preview cookie that asks for a page is sent to
  `{public_url}/preview-auth?to=<the URL>`. The console there (signed in)
  checks that the URL's host is under this luxd's preview domain, with
  its scheme and port (`GET /v1/whoami`'s `previewDomain`,
  `previewScheme`, `previewPort`), finds the server of that hostname
  (`GET /v1/servers?hostname=`), mints a preview ticket for it
  (`POST /v1/servers/{id}/tickets`) and sends the browser to
  `<url>/.lux/auth?ticket=…&to=<path>`, where luxd sets the cookie and
  redirects to the path. A ticket minted for a Run
  (`POST /v1/runs/{id}/tickets`, kind `preview`) signs in to any server
  attached to it. Other requests without a cookie get 401. Without
  `preview.domain`, or when previews sign in through Cloudflare Access,
  luxd mints no preview tickets (409 `previews_off`) and whoami's
  `previewDomain` is null.
- **Routing:** a ready server of a running Run is proxied, over a tunnel
  stream to its current placement: HTTP, WebSockets and server-sent
  events. A server that **wakes on request** with no Run serving it gets
  the waking page at once ([waking on
  request](concepts.md#waking-on-request)); the page polls `/.lux/wait`.
  Its variants: waiting for a host, moving, no answer (with "Ask again", a
  form posting to `/.lux/wake`), did not start (its exit code, last stderr
  line, a link to its log in the console), gone (404). A server that does
  not wake: a request to it starting, or to its Run on its way to running,
  waits up to `hold_for`; otherwise a small status page says why (not
  running, stopped, exited, moving, starting). `/.lux/…` paths are luxd's
  on every preview host, never the server's.
- **Previews on this machine** (a demo): `scheme = "http"` with a domain
  under `localhost` (`lux.localhost`), which browsers resolve to this
  machine without DNS, and `public_port` the listener's port. The cookie
  is then `lux_preview` (host-only, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, not
  `Secure`): browsers keep no `__Host-` cookie over http. luxd refuses
  `http` for any other domain.
- **One luxd:** the proxy reaches a Run's host through that host's
  connection, which is to one luxd; the listener of another luxd shows the
  server as not answering. Run previews through the luxd your runners
  connect to. Wakes and idleness are decided in the database, so any luxd
  may serve the waking page.
- **Throughput:** proxied bytes travel as base64 JSON frames over the
  runner's WebSocket. A tunnel is flow controlled: the runner sends at
  most 4 MiB ahead of what luxd has passed on, so a slow client slows the
  server's writes rather than losing the response (a runner from before
  flow control relays without it, and a far-behind response is cut off,
  until it updates itself). Fine for dev servers and demos; not a CDN.

The preview listener is what the Run's authors' code is served from: see
[security](security.md#previews).

### What only operators can do

`lux tenants ls`, `lux migrate`, choosing a host (`resume --to`), and
resuming without supplying secrets. Tenants and keys are made with `luxd
admin` only, never through the API, by operators or anyone.
